Github-BuildBot CommitBot
=========================

This is a Merb "very-flat" application.  You need to first do:

$ gem install merb-core json

In order to get Merb installed.  Once that's done, you can fire up your new github-BuildBot CommitBot with:

merb -I github-buildbot-commitbot.rb

Before you start sending things through it, I recommend you pop open the source and edit the
variables at the top.  Specifically:

  c[:project]             = "Name of Project",
  c[:buildhost]           = "BuildBot Hostname",
  c[:git_dir]             = "path to local Git repo",
  c[:git_buildbot]        = "path to Buildbot git_buildbot.py script",
  c[:tmp_commit_file]     = "location of temporary file to hold commit data",
