Github-BuildBot CommitBot
=========================

This is a Merb "very-flat" application.  You need to first do:

$ gem install merb-core json

In order to get Merb installed.  Once that's done, you can fire up your new github-BuildBot CommitBot with:

merb -I github-buildbot-commitbot.rb

Before you start sending things through it, I recommend you pop open the source and edit the
variables at the top.  Specifically:

  c[:project] = "Example",
  c[:mailto] = "<adam@example.com>",
  c[:mailfrom] = "Commit Bot <noreply@example.com>",
